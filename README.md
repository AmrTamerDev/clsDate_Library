📅 clsDate - Custom Date Management Library

🌟 Project Overview

clsDate is a C++ class designed for efficient date management and manipulation. It provides a range of functionalities including date initialization, formatting, arithmetic operations, validation, and business day calculations. This library simplifies working with dates in C++ applications that require precise and flexible date handling.

✨ Features

🗓️ Date Management

Date Initialization: Create date objects using specific day, month, and year values.

Date Formatting: Convert dates into formatted string representations.

Date Comparison: Compare two dates to determine order or equality.

Leap Year Calculation: Identify whether a year is a leap year.

Date Arithmetic: Add or subtract days, weeks, months, and years.

Date Validation: Check if a given date is valid.

Day & Month Information: Retrieve day and month names, and calculate days in a month.

📆 Business Day & Vacation Calculations

Calculate Business Days: Compute the number of business days between two dates.

Number of Vacation Days: Determine non-business days within a date range.

Finish Vacation Date: Calculate the return date after a set vacation duration, skipping weekends.

🔍 Comparison & Utility Functions

Compare Dates: Determine if one date is before, after, or equal to another date.

Days Until End of Year: Compute remaining days until the end of the year.

🏗️ Code Structure

🛠️ clsDate Class

Properties:

Day, Month, Year – Represent the date components.

Methods:

DateToString() – Convert date to string format.

isLeapYear() – Check if a year is a leap year.

isValidDate() – Validate a date based on calendar rules.

IncreaseDateByOneDay() – Increment a date by one day.

DaysUntilTheEndOfYear() – Compute remaining days in the year.

isDate1BeforeDate2(), isDate1AfterDate2(), isDate1EqualToDate2() – Compare two dates.

NumberOfVacationDays() – Calculate the number of vacation (non-business) days.

CalculateBusinessDay() – Count business days between two dates.

FinishVacationDate() – Determine the return date after a vacation period.

⚙️ How It Works

Core Components:

🗓️ Date Operations:

Initialize a date using a constructor.

Perform date arithmetic operations like adding or subtracting days.

Compare two dates using built-in comparison functions.

Validate a date before using it in calculations.

📆 Business & Vacation Days:

Calculate business days within a range.

Determine the number of vacation days, skipping weekends.

Compute the exact return date after a vacation period.

📚 Further Improvements
